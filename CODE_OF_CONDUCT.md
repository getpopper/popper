# Participation Guidelines

This guidelines cover our behaviour as contributors, volunteers, vendors, and for anyone else involved in working on Popper.

## How to Treat Each Other

* Try to be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Don't threaten violence
* Empower others to do their best
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision by others
* Do unto others as you would have them do unto you

## Inclusion and Diversity

We welcome and encourage participation by everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or how others perceive you: we welcome you to help contribute.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, language, gender, etc.

## Raising Issues

If you believe you're experiencing practices which don't meet our guidelines above, please immediately [email us](mailto:ivotron@ucsc.edu).

We reserve the right to refuse contributions from anyone violating the spirit of these policies.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, development on Popper is done in the open on GitHub (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/getpopper/popper)). We hope contributors will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration and will work with an open ethos.
