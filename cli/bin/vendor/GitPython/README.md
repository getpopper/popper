## GitPython

GitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain,
or low-level like git-plumbing.

It provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data, and additionally
allows you to access the git repository more directly using either a pure python implementation,
or the faster, but more resource intensive *git command* implementation.

The object database implementation is optimized for handling large quantities of objects and large datasets,
which is achieved by using low-level structures and data streaming.


### REQUIREMENTS

GitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available
in your `PATH` for most operations.
If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it by setting
the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.

* Git (1.7.x or newer)
* Python 2.7 to 3.7.

The list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.
The installer takes care of installing them for you.

### INSTALL

If you have downloaded the source code:

    python setup.py install

or if you want to obtain a copy from the Pypi repository:

    pip install GitPython

Both commands will install the required package dependencies.

A distribution package can be obtained for manual installation at:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython

If you like to clone from source, you can do it like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
git submodule update --init --recursive
./init-tests-after-clone.sh
```

### Limitations

#### Leakage of System Resources

GitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it tends to
leak system resources. It was written in a time where destructors (as implemented
in the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.

In case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search the
codebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.

Another way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into a
separate process which can be dropped periodically.

#### Windows support

For *Windows*, we do regularly test it on [Appveyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/)
but not all test-cases pass - you may help improve them by exploring
[Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).

### RUNNING TESTS

*Important*: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure to have executed
the `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository root. Otherwise
you will encounter test failures.

On *Windows*, make sure you have `git-daemon` in your PATH.  For MINGW-git, the `git-daemon.exe`
exists in `Git\mingw64\libexec\git-core\`; CYGWIN has no daemon, but should get along fine
with MINGW's.

The easiest way to run tests is by using [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)
a wrapper around virtualenv. It will take care of setting up environments with the proper
dependencies installed and execute test commands. To install it simply:

    pip install tox

Then run:

    tox


For more fine-grained control, you can use `nose`.

### INFRASTRUCTURE

* [User Documentation](http://gitpython.readthedocs.org)
* [Questions and Answers](http://stackexchange.com/filters/167317/gitpython)
 * Please post on stackoverflow and use the `gitpython` tag
* [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues)
  * Post reproducible bugs and feature requests as a new issue.
    Please be sure to provide the following information if posting bugs:
    * GitPython version (e.g. `import git; git.__version__`)
    * Python version (e.g. `python --version`)
    * The encountered stack-trace, if applicable
    * Enough information to allow reproducing the issue

### How to make a new release

* Update/verify the version in the `VERSION` file
* Update/verify that the changelog has been updated
* Commit everything
* Run `git tag -s <version>` to tag the version in Git
* Run `make release`
* Finally, set the upcoming version in the `VERSION` file, usually be
  incrementing the patch level, and possibly by appending `-dev`. Probably you
  want to `git push` once more.

### How to verify a release

Please only use releases from `pypi` as you can verify the respective source
tarballs.

This script shows how to verify the tarball was indeed created by the authors of
this project:

```
curl https://pypi.python.org/packages/5b/38/0433c06feebbfbb51d644129dbe334031c33d55af0524326266f847ae907/GitPython-2.1.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl#md5=6b73ae86ee2dbab6da8652b2d875013a  > gitpython.whl
curl https://pypi.python.org/packages/5b/38/0433c06feebbfbb51d644129dbe334031c33d55af0524326266f847ae907/GitPython-2.1.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl.asc > gitpython-signature.asc
gpg --verify gitpython-signature.asc gitpython.whl
```

which outputs

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Dec 11 17:34:17 2017 CET
gpg:                using RSA key C3BC52BD76E2C23BAC6EC06A665F99FA9D99966C
gpg:                issuer "byronimo@gmail.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Sebastian Thiel (I do trust in Rust!) <byronimo@gmail.com>" [ultimate]
```

You can verify that the keyid indeed matches the release-signature key provided in this
repository by looking at the keys details:

```
gpg --list-packets ./release-verification-key.asc
```

You can verify that the commit adding it was also signed by it using:

```
git show --show-signature  ./release-verification-key.asc
```

If you would like to trust it permanently, you can import and sign it:

```
gpg --import ./release-verification-key.asc
gpg --edit-key 88710E60

> sign
> save
```

Now that there seems to be a massive user base, this should be motivation enough to let git-python
return to a proper state, which means

* no open pull requests
* no open issues describing bugs
