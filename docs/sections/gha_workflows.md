# Workflow Language and Runtime

This section introduces the [HCL-based][hcl] [workflow language][wfl] 
used by Popper and also describes the execution runtime.

> **NOTE**: The workflow language employed by Popper is **NOT** 
> supported by the official Github Actions platform. The HCL syntax 
> for workflows was [introduced by Github on 02/2019][parser] and 
> later [deprecated on 09/2019][drophcl]. The Popper project still 
> uses the HCL syntax.

[wfl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system
[parser]: https://github.blog/2019-02-07-an-open-source-parser-for-github-actions/
[drophcl]: https://github.blog/changelog/2019-09-17-github-actions-will-stop-running-workflows-written-in-hcl/

## Language

The following example workflow contains one workflow block and two 
action blocks.

```hcl
workflow "IDENTIFIER" {
  resolves = "ACTION2"
}

action "ACTION1" {
  uses = "docker://image1"
}

action "ACTION2" {
  needs = "ACTION1"
  uses = "docker://image2"
}
```

In this example, the workflow invokes `ACTION2` using `resolves`, but 
because it `needs` `ACTION1`, the `ACTION1` block executes first. 
`ACTION2` will execute once `ACTION1` has successfully completed. For 
more information on why this happens, see "Workflow attributes" and 
"Action attributes" below.

### Workflow blocks

A workflow file contains only one `workflow` blocks, each with a 
unique identifier and the attributes outlined in the workflow 
attributes table.

#### Workflow attributes

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Name</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>resolves</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Identifies the action(s) to invoke. Can be a string or an array of strings. Any dependencies of the named action listed in the <code>needs</code> attribute are also invoked. In the example workflow above, <code>ACTION2</code> runs first via the <code>resolves</code> attribute. When more than one action is listed, like the example workflow block above, the actions are executed in parallel.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--

|  Name         | Description |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------|
|  `resolves`   | Identifies the action(s) to invoke. Can be a string or an array of strings. Any dependencies of the named action listed in the `needs` attribute are also invoked. In the example workflow above, `ACTION2` runs first via the `resolves` attribute. When more than one action is listed, like the example workflow block above, the actions are executed in parallel. |

-->

### Action blocks

A workflow file may contain any number of action blocks. Action blocks 
must have a unique identifier and must have a `uses` attribute. 
Example action block:

```hcl
action "IDENTIFIER" {
  needs = "ACTION1"
  uses = "docker://image2"
}
```

#### Action attributes

<table>
<thead>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>needs</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Identifies actions that must complete successfully before this action will be invoked. It can be a string or an array of strings. In the example workflow above, <code>ACTION2</code> is executed after <code>ACTION1</code> is successfully completed. <strong>Note:</strong> When actions with a common <code>needs</code> dependency run in parallel and one action fails, the remaining actions are cancelled automatically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>uses</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The Docker image that will run the action. For example, <code>uses = &quot;node:10&quot;</code>. See &quot;Using a Dockerfile image in an action&quot; for more examples.</td>

Use the <code>runs</code> attribute when the <code>Dockerfile</code> does not specify an <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> or you want to override the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. The <code>runs</code> attribute does not invoke a shell by default. To use environment variables with the <code>runs</code> instruction, you must include a shell to expand the variables, for example: <code>runs = [&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;echo $GITHUB_SHA&quot;]</code>.

<td style="text-align:left">The arguments to pass to the action. The <code>args</code> can be a string or array. If you provide <code>args</code> in a string, the string is split around whitespace.

Alternatively, if your <code>Dockerfile</code> uses an <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> to run the same command (<code>&quot;sh -c&quot;</code>), <code>args</code> will execute in a command shell.

### Using a `Dockerfile` image in an action

When creating an action block, you can use an action defined in the 
same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a 
[published Docker container image](https://hub.docker.com/). An action 
block refers to the images using the `uses` attribute. It's strongly 
recommended to include the version of the action you are using by 
specifying a SHA or Docker tag number. If you don't specify a version 
and the action owner publishes an update, it may break your workflows 
or have unexpected behavior. Here are some examples of how you can 
refer to an action on a public Git repository or Docker container registry:

<table>

<th style="text-align:left">Template</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>{url}/{user}/{repo}@{ref}</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">A specific branch, ref, or SHA in a public Git repository. If <code>url</code> is ommited, <code>github.com</code> is used by default. <strong>Example:</strong>  <code>https://bitbucket.com/popperized/ansible@master</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>{url}/{user}/{repo}/{path}@{ref}</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">A subdirectory in a public Git repository at a specific branch, ref, or SHA. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>git@gitlab.com:popperized/geni/build-context@v2.0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>./path/to/dir</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The path to the directory that contains the action in your workflow&#39;s repository. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>./actions/my-action</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>docker://{image}:{tag}</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">A Docker image published on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>docker://alpine:3.8</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>docker://{host}/{image}:{tag}</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">A Docker image in a public registry. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>docker://gcr.io/cloud-builders/gradle</code>.</td>

</tbody>
</table>

### Referencing private Github repositories in an action

We can make use of actions located in private Github repositories by defining a ```GITHUB_API_TOKEN``` environment variable that the ```popper run``` command reads and uses to clone private Github repositories. To accomplish this, the repository referenced in the ```uses``` attribute is assumed to be private and, to access it, an API token from Github is needed (see instructions <a href = "https://github.com/settings/tokens">here</a>). The token needs to have permissions to read the private repository in question. To run a workflow that references private repositories:

```bash
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=access_token_here
popper run
```

If the access token doesn't have permissions to access private repositories, the popper run command will fail.

## Execution Runtime

This section describes the runtime environment where a workflow 
executes.

### Environment variables

An action can create, read, and modify environment variables. When you 
create an action in a workflow, you can define environment variables 
using the `env` attribute in your action block. For example, you could 
set the variables `FIRST_NAME`, `MIDDLE_NAME`, and `LAST_NAME` using 
this example action block:

```hcl
action "hello world" {
  uses = "./my-action"
  env = {
    FIRST_NAME  = "Mona"
    MIDDLE_NAME = "Lisa"
    LAST_NAME   = "Octocat"
  }
}
```

When an action runs, Popper also sets these environment variables in 
the runtime environment:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Environment variable</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>HOME</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The path to the home directory used to store user data. Value: <code>/github/home</code>.</td>
</tr>

<td style="text-align:left"><code>GITHUB_ACTION</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The name of the action.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">The name of the person or app that initiated the workflow. For example, <code>octocat</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>GITHUB_REPOSITORY</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The owner and repository name. For example, <code>octocat/Hello-World</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The workspace path. Value: <code>/github/workspace</code>. <strong>Note:</strong> actions must be run by the default Docker user (root).

<td style="text-align:left">The branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow. For example, <code>refs/heads/feature-branch-1</code>. If neither a branch or tag is available for the event type, the variable will not exist.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--

| Environment variable   | Description |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOME`                 | The path to the home directory used. Value: `/github/home`. |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`      | The name of the workflow. |
| `GITHUB_ACTION`        | The name of the action. |
| `GITHUB_ACTOR`         | The name of the person or app that initiated the workflow. For example, `octocat`. |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`    | The owner and repository name. For example, `octocat/Hello-World`. |
| `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`     | The workspace path. Value: `/github/workspace`. **Note:** actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure your Dockerfile does not set the `USER` instruction, otherwise you will not be able to access `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. |
| `GITHUB_SHA`           | The commit SHA that triggered the workflow. |
| `GITHUB_REF`           | The branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow. For example, `refs/heads/feature-branch-1`. If neither a branch or tag is available for the event type, the variable will not exist. |

-->

### Naming conventions

Any new environment variables you set that point to a location on the
file system should have a `_PATH` suffix. The `HOME` and
`GITHUB_WORKSPACE` default variables are exceptions to this convention
because the words \"home\" and \"workspace\" already imply a location.

### Filesystem

Two directories are bind-mounted on the `/github` path prefix. These two directories are shared from the host machine to the containers running in a workflow:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Directory</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>/github/home</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The <code>HOME</code> directory for the user running the workflow. This directory path is set in the <code>HOME</code> environment variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>/github/workspace</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The working directory of the Docker container. Actions execute in this directory. The path to this directory is set in the <code>GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code> environment variable. This directory is where the repository (with version <code>GITHUB_SHA</code>) that triggered the workflow. An action can modify the contents of this directory, which subsequent actions can access. <strong>Note:</strong> actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure your Dockerfile does not set the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user"><code>USER</code> instruction</a>, otherwise you will not be able to access <code>GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--

| `/github/home`                  | The `HOME` directory for the user running the workflow. This directory path is set in the `HOME` environment variable. |
| `/github/workspace`             | The working directory of the Docker container. Actions execute in this directory. The path to this directory is set in the `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` environment variable. This directory is where the repository (with version `GITHUB_SHA`) that triggered the workflow. An action can modify the contents of this directory, which subsequent actions can access. **Note:** actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure your Dockerfile does not set the [`USER` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user), otherwise you will not be able to access `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. |

-->

#### Exit codes and statuses

You can use exit codes to provide an action\'s status. Popper uses the 
exit code to set the workflow execution status, which can be 
`success`, `neutral`, or `failure`:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Exit status</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Check run status</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>0</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>success</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The action completed successfully and other tasks that depends on it can begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>78</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>neutral</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">The configuration error exit status (<a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/6c262608dd9129e8699bd3c3a84425b8076b83ae/include/sysexits.h#L114"><code>EX_CONFIG</code></a>) indicates that the action terminated but did not fail. For example, a <a href="https://github.com/popperized/bin/tree/master/filter">filter action</a> can use a <code>neutral</code> status to stop a workflow if certain conditions aren\&#39;t met. When an action returns this exit status, Popper terminates all concurrently running actions and prevents any future actions from starting. The associated check run shows a <code>neutral</code> status, and the overall check suite will have a status of <code>success</code> as long as there were no failed or cancelled actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">All other codes</td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>failure</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Any other exit code indicates the action failed. When an action fails, all concurrent actions are cancelled and future actions are skipped. The check run and check suite both get a <code>failure</code> status.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--

| :---------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`               | `success`          | The action completed successfully and other tasks that depends on it can begin. |
| `78`              | `neutral`          | The configuration error exit status ([`EX_CONFIG`](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/6c262608dd9129e8699bd3c3a84425b8076b83ae/include/sysexits.h#L114)) indicates that the action terminated but did not fail. For example, a [filter action](https://github.com/popperized/bin/tree/master/filter) can use a `neutral` status to stop a workflow if certain conditions aren\'t met. When an action returns this exit status, Popper terminates all concurrently running actions and prevents any future actions from starting.

-->

### Alternative container engines

By default, actions in Popper workflows run in Docker. In addition to 
Docker, Popper can execute workflows in other runtimes by interacting 
with other container engines. A `--runtime <engine>` flag for the 
`popper run` can be used to invoke alternative engines (where 
`<engine>` is one of the supported engines). When no value for the 
`--runtime` option is given, Popper executes workflows in Docker.

> **NOTE**: As part of our roadmap, we plan to add support for the 
> [Podman](https://podman.io/) runtime. Open a [new
> issue](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues/new) to request 
> another runtime you would want Popper to support.

#### Singularity

Popper can execute a workflow in systems where Singularity 3.2+ is 
available. To execute a workflow in Singularity containers:

```bash
popper run --runtime singularity
```

##### Limitations

  * The use of `ARG` in `Dockerfile`s is not supported by Singularity.
  * Currently, the `--reuse` functionality of the `popper run` command 
    is not available when running in Singularity.

#### Vagrant

While technically not a container engine, executing workflows inside a 
VM allows users to run workflows in machines where a container engine 
is not available. In this scenario, Popper uses [Vagrant][vagrant] to 
spawn a VM provisioned with Docker. It then executes workflows by 
communicating with the Docker daemon that runs inside the VM. To 
execute a workflow in Vagrant:

```bash
popper run --runtime vagrant
```

[vagrant]: https://vagrantup.com/

##### Limitations

Currently, only one workflow can be executed at the time in Vagrant 
runtime, since popper assumes that there is only one VM running at any 
given point in time.

#### Host

There are situations where a container runtime is not available and 
cannot be installed. In these cases, an action can execute directly on 
the host where the `popper` command is running by making use of the 
special `sh` value for the `uses` attribute. This value instructs 
Popper to execute the command (given in the `args` attribute) or 
script (specified in the `runs` attribute) directly on the host. For 
example:

```hcl
action "run on host" {
  uses = "sh"
  args = ["ls", "-la"]
}

action "another execution on host" {
  uses = "sh"
  runs = "./path/to/my/script.sh"
  args = "args"
}
```

In the first example action above, the `ls -la` command is executed on 
the root of the repository folder (the repository storing the 
`.workflow` file). In the second one shows how to execute a script. 
The obvious downside of running actions on the host is that, depending 
on the command being executed, the workflow might not be portable.

> **NOTE**: The working directory (the value of `$PWD` when a command 
> or script is executed) is the root of the project. Thus, to ensure 
> portability, scripts should make use of paths relative to the root 
> of the folder. If absolute paths are needed, the `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` 
> variable can be used.
