Popper
======

Popper is an experimentation protocol for organizing a academic article's 
artifacts following a DevOps approach (sometimes referred to as "SciOps"). This 
documentation describes the experimentation protocol and the Popper CLI tool; 
it gives examples from multiple domains showing how to follow the protocol; and 
also shows how to use a CI system to continuously validate Popperized 
experiments.
