Popper
======

Popper is a workflow execution engine based on Github Actions (GHA) that allows 
you to execute GHA workflows locally on your machine. Popper workflows are 
defined in HCL syntax and behave like GHA workflows. The main difference with 
respect to GHA workflows is that, through some extensions to the GHA syntax, a 
Popper workflow can execute actions in other runtimes in addition to Docker.
