Popper is a tool for defining and executing [container-native][cn] 
workflows in Docker, as well as [other container engines][engines]. 
With Popper, you define a workflow in a YAML file, and then execute it 
with a single command. A workflow file looks like this:

```yaml
version: '1'
steps:
- uses: docker://byrnedo/alpine-curl:0.1.8
  args: [-LO, https://github.com/datasets/co2-fossil-global/raw/master/global.csv]

- uses: docker://python:3.8.1-alpine
  args: [scripts/get_mean.py, global.csv, 'Per Capita']
```

Assuming the above is stored in a `wf.yml` file, the workflow gets 
executed by running:

```bash
popper run -f wf.yml
```

Keep reading down to find [installation instructions](#installation). 
The full example above can be found [here][minimalpython]. For more 
information on the YAML syntax, see [here][cnwf].

The high-level goals of this project are to provide:

  * **Lightweight workflow definition syntax.** Defining a workflow is 
    as simple as writing file in a [lightweight YAML syntax][cnwf] and 
    invoking `popper run` (see demo above). If you're familiar with 
    [Docker Compose][compose], you can think of Popper as Compose but 
    for workflows instead of services.
  * **An abstraction over container runtimes**. In addition to Docker, 
    Popper can seamlessly execute workflows in other runtimes by 
    interacting with distinct container engines. Popper currently 
    supports [Singularity][sylabs] and we are working on adding 
    [Podman][podman].
  * **Run on resource managers**. Popper can also execute workflows on 
    a variety of resource managers and schedulers such as Kubernetes 
    and SLURM, without requiring any modifications to a workflow YAML 
    file. We currently support SLURM and are working on adding support 
    for Kubernetes.
  * **Continuous integration**. Generate configuration files for 
    distinct CI services, allowing users to run the exact same 
    workflows they run locally on Travis, Jenkins, Gitlab, Circle and 
    others.
  * **Workflow development**. Aid in the implementation and debugging 
    of [workflows][scaffold], and provide with an extensive list of 
    [example workflows](https://github.com/popperized) that can serve 
    as a starting point.

## Installation

To run workflows, you need to have Python 3.6+, Git and a container 
engine installed ([Docker][docker] and [Singularity][singularity] are 
currently supported). To install Popper you can use 
[`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). We recommend to install in a 
virtual environment (see [here][venv] for more on `virtualenv`). To 
install:

```bash
pip install popper
```

Once installed, you can get an overview and list of available 
commands:

```bash
popper --help
```

For a Quickstart guide on how to use Popper, look [here][getting_started].
