Popper is a tool for defining and executing container-native workflows 
in Docker, as well as other container engines. With Popper, you define 
a workflow in a YAML file, and then execute it with a single command. 
A workflow file looks like this:

```yaml
steps:
# download CSV file with data on global CO2 emissions
- id: download
  uses: docker://byrnedo/alpine-curl:0.1.8
  args: [-LO, https://github.com/datasets/co2-fossil-global/raw/master/global.csv]

# obtain the transpose of the global CO2 emissions table
- id: get-transpose
  uses: docker://getpopper/csvtool:2.4
  args: [transpose, global.csv, -o, global_transposed.csv]
```

Assuming the above is stored in a `.popper.yml` file in your project 
folder, this entire workflow gets executed by running:

```bash
cd /path/to/my/project/

popper run
```

Running a single step:

```bash
popper run get-transpose
```

Starting a shell inside the `get-transpose` step container:

```bash
popper sh get-transpose
```

## Installation

To install or upgrade Popper, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getpopper/popper/master/install.sh | sh
```

[Docker][docker] is required to run Popper and the installer will 
abort if the `docker` command cannot be invoked from your shell. For 
other installation options, including installing for use with 
Singularity or for setting up a developing environment for Popper, 
[read the complete installation instructions][installation].

Once installed, you can get an overview and list of available 
commands:

```bash
popper help
```

Read the [Quickstart Guide][getting_started] to learn the basics of 
how to use Popper. Or browse the [Official documentation][docs].

## Features

  * **Lightweight workflow and task automation syntax.** Defining a list of 
    steps is as simple as writing file in a [lightweight YAML syntax][cnwf] and 
    invoking `popper run` (see demo above). If you're familiar with [Docker 
    Compose][compose], you can think of Popper as Compose but for workflows 
    instead of services.

  * **An abstraction over container runtimes**. In addition to Docker, 
    Popper can seamlessly execute workflows in other runtimes by 
    interacting with distinct container engines. Popper currently 
    supports [Singularity][sylabs] and we are working on adding 
    [Podman][podman].

  * **An abstraction over resource managers**. Popper can also execute workflows on 
    a variety of resource managers and schedulers such as Kubernetes and SLURM, 
    without requiring any modifications to a workflow YAML file. We currently 
    support SLURM and are working on adding support for Kubernetes.

  * **An abstraction over CI services**. Define a pipeline once and 
    then instruct Popper to generate configuration files for distinct 
    CI services, allowing users to run the exact same workflows they 
    run locally on Travis, Jenkins, Gitlab, Circle and others. See the 
    [`examples/`](./examples/ci/) folder for examples on how to 
    automate CI tasks for multiple projects (Go, C++, Node, etc.).

  * **Aid in workflow development**. Aid in the implementation and 
    [debugging][pp-sh] of workflows, and provide with an extensive 
    list of [example workflows](https://github.com/popperized) that 
    can serve as a starting point.

## What Problem Does Popper Solve?

Popper is a container-native workflow execution and task automation 
engine. In practice, when we work following the container-native 
paradigm, we end up interactively executing multiple `docker 
pull|build|run` commands in order to build containers, compile code, 
test applications, deploy software, etc. Keeping track of which 
`docker` commands we have executed, in which order, and which flags 
were passed to each, can quickly become unmanageable, difficult to 
document (think of outdated README instructions) and error prone.

The goal of Popper is to bring order to this chaotic scenario by 
providing a framework for clearly and explicitly defining 
container-native tasks. You can think of Popper as tool for wrapping 
all these manual tasks in a lightweight, machine-readable, 
self-documented format (YAML).

While this sounds simple at first, it has significant implications: 
results in time-savings, improves communication and in general unifies 
development, testing and deployment workflows. As a developer or user 
of "Popperized" container-native projects, you only need to learn one 
tool, and leave the execution details to Popper, whether is to build 
and tests applications locally, on a remote CI server or a Kubernetes 
cluster.
