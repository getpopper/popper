Popper is a convention for generating reproducible papers. This 
repository contains:

  * A [CLI tool](popper/) to help bootstrap research articles that 
    adhere to the convention by re-using [experiment templates](https://github.com/ivotron/popper-templates).
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/ivotron/popper/wiki/Getting-Started) 
    about the convention.
