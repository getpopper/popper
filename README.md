Popper is a workflow execution engine based on [Github 
actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (GHA) that allows you to 
execute GHA workflows locally on your machine. Popper workflows are 
defined in [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) syntax and behave 
like GHA workflows. The main difference with respect to GHA workflows 
is that, through [several extensions to the GHA 
syntax](https://popper.rtfd.io/en/latest/sections/extensions.html), a 
Popper workflow can execute actions in other runtimes in addition to 
Docker. The workflow language is strictly a superset of GHA workflow 
language so Popper can run a GHA workflow locally as if it was being 
executed by the GHA platform.

In addition to running a GHA workflow locally, the goal of this 
project is to provide the following functionality:

  * **Runtimes**. Actions can execute locally on the host where the 
    `popper` command runs (i.e. "outside" a container), thus not 
    strictly depending on having Docker installed. We are working in 
    adding support for other runtimes such as 
    [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), 
    [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/), [Conda](https://conda.io) and 
    others (see [this 
    project](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/projects/12) for 
    more).
  * **Continuous integration**. Generate configuration files for 
    distinct CI services, allowing users to execute Popper workflows 
    on these services (Travis, Jenkins, Gitlab and Circle supported).
  * **Action and workflow search**. Provide users with a searchable 
    catalog of available actions and workflows so that they can re-use 
    as much as possible what others have already done.
  * **Scaffolding**. Aid in the implementation of new actions and 
    workflows, as well as extending existing ones.
  * **Action library**. As part of our efforts, we maintain a list of 
    actions available at <https://github.com/popperized>.
