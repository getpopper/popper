Popper is a [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) 
(GHA) execution engine that allows you to run GHA workflows (in [HCL 
syntax][hcl-to-yml]) locally on your machine and on CI services. The 
goal of this project is to provide the following functionality:

  * **Continuous integration**. Generate configuration files for 
    distinct CI services, allowing users to execute GHA workflows on 
    Travis, Jenkins, Gitlab or Circle. [See here for more][ci].
  * **Other Runtimes**. In addition to Docker, Popper can execute 
    workflows in other container runtimes. We currently support 
    [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/) and [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)
    and are working on adding [Podman](https://podman.io) to the list (see [here for more][runtimedocs]).
  * **Action search**. Provide with a [searchable 
    catalog][search] of publicly available actions so that users can 
    easily find which actions already exist (do not re-invent the 
    wheel!).
  * **Scaffolding**. Aid in the implementation of [new actions and 
    workflows][scaffold].
  * **Action library**. Provide with a list of reusable actions and 
    example workflows <https://github.com/popperized>.

## Installation

To run workflows, you need to have Git and a container runtime installed
([Docker][docker], [Singularity][singularity] and [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) are currently
supported). To install Popper you can use 
[`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). We recommend to install in a 
virtual environment (see [here][venv] for more on `virtualenv`). To 
install:

```bash
pip install popper
```

Once installed, you can get an overview and list of available 
commands:

```bash
popper --help
```
