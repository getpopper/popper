# Contributing to Popper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Popper :tada:!

This document is a part of a set of guidelines for contributing to Popper on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

We're working with scientists in genomics, weather prediction, playable media, distributed systems (and adding more domains) to have them use DevOps tools and follow software engineering best-practices when they implement experiments associated to academic articles. Our goal is to lower the barriers for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge.

## Participation guidelines

Popper adheres to our code of conduct, [posted in this repository](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating or contributing to Popper, you're expected to uphold this code. If you encounter unacceptable behavior, please immediately [email us](mailto:ivo@cs.ucsc.edu).

## What to working on

Take a look at the issues in our [future milestones](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/milestones) or browse some [bugs](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/labels/bug) to get started!

You can also see the work that's being done on various [GitHub issues](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues) through [our branches](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/branches).

## How to contribute changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you want to contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## How to report bugs

We track bugs as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues). Before posting a bug as a new issue, [please do a search](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) to see if the bug you're experiencing was already reported by someone else. If it was, add a comment to that issue instead of creating a new one.

### How to submit good bug reports

A more detailed bug report will help people track down and fix your issue faster. Try to include the following in your bug report if you can: 

* Create a detailed title in your report to properly explain your issue
* Include any screen captures or terminal output if necessary.
* List what version of Popper you are using.
* Describe an exact sequence of steps that can reproduce your issue. If you can't reliably replicate your issues, explain what you were doing before the problem happened and how often it happens.
* Is this a new bug? Include when you started having these issues.

Post any bugs, requests, or questions on the [GitHub issues page for Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues)!
